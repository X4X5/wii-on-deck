This repository is about bringing iconic Wii themes to the Steam Deck. I might also do DS themes down the road, who knows :p

# Hi all!
Hello! Updated this README to make known that policies to AudioLoader have changed, and I'll be changing how I go about uploading playable themes from now on. If you want to know more, please refer to [this README for more information.](https://github.com/X4X5/eshop-on-deck#changes-to-the-audioloader-policy)
